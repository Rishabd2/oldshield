Check the source URL of the iframe: Make sure that the source URL is correct and that it loads without any errors.

Verify the dimensions of the iframe: Make sure that the height and width of the iframe are set correctly and that the content is displayed within the frame.

Test the iframe in different browsers: Test the iframe in different browsers to ensure that it displays correctly in each one.

Verify the content of the iframe: Make sure that the content displayed in the iframe is correct and that there are no errors or broken links.

Check for any security issues: Ensure that the iframe does not contain any malicious content or security vulnerabilities.

By following these steps, you can check if the iframe is implemented correctly and ensure that it is displaying the content as intended.
